# Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp

This repo contains all of the practical exercises I did during the Data Analytics Bootcamp @ https://www.ironhack.com/en (Mexico City campus). The entire part time course lasted for 6 months (Sept 2020 - March 2021) with an additional career week. It was divided into 3 modules:

Module 1 - Data Extraction & Transformation;

Module 2 - Data Analysis & Visualization;

Module 3 - Data Modeling.
